#+title: Tools Integration
This document covers how to add Cakelisp support to various different tools/editors.
* Counting lines of code
Use the following setup to [[https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc][cloc]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cloc --force-lang="Lisp",cake [dirs]
#+END_SRC
* Github syntax highlighting
Create a ~.gitattributes~ file in the project root, then add the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
*.cake linguist-language=lisp
#+END_SRC
* Emacs
Add the following to your ~.emacs~ configuration:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; Path given as an example; change it to where you put cakelisp
  (load-file "~/Repositories/cakelisp/tools/cakelisp.el")
#+END_SRC
** Specify indentation of custom forms
You will need to specify indentation of custom forms because I haven't written an Emacs parser to automatically determine indentation from macro/generator signatures yet. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun mylib-cakelisp-mode ()
    (put 'each-in-strdict 'lisp-indent-function 2)
    (put 'scope-timed 'lisp-indent-function 1))

  (add-hook 'cakelisp-mode-hook mylib-cakelisp-mode)
#+END_SRC

This will make ~each-in-strdict~ indent all symbols after the first two arguments to the body depth.

The number represents how many arguments are expected to the function.
